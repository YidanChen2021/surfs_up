## Overview
This project was conducted to provide analysis and findings around the weather at Oahu in Hawaii, in order to support the decision making for ivesting a surf and ice cream shop there. This part of the analysis particularly focus on the temperature trend in June and December to assess the susitainability of the business. 
## Findings and Results
* The average temperaure in June is 75 F, while the average in December is 71F. It shows a slight difference of 4F between June to Devember.
* The temperature range for June is between 64F to 85F, while it's between 56F to 83F in December. The lowest temperature has a 8 degree differences, while the highest temperature shows only 2 degree difference. 
* The standard deviation of temperature in December is slightly higher than it in June. This indicates more fluctuatted temperaures in December.

## Summary
Overall, the average temperature between June and December is very close, which could indicate a less fluctuated temperature range throughout the year. More analysis are recommended to evaluate the temperature trend for all 12 months of the year and to take consideration of temperatures at different locations. This will help to forecaste the temperature impact to business through out the year and pre-plan for potential promotions or marketing strategy, as well as help indentify the locations with relative steady weather for opening the shop.
